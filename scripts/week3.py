# **Exercises**
# 1. Add `[1,2,3]` to every row of a 3Ã—3 matrix.  

# 2. Compute the dot product of `[1,2,3]` and `[4,5,6]`.  
# 3. Multiply a 3Ã—3 matrix by a scalar (5).  
# 4. Normalize a random vector (length 5) so its sum = 1.  

# **Stretch Challenges**
# - Create a 5Ã—5 matrix of random numbers, subtract the mean of each column.  
# - Compute cosine similarity between two random vectors using dot product.
